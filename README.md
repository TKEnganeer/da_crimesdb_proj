# Boston Crime Reports db
In this project I built a simple database from from scratch using a dataset from a Boston crime report csv file with the Postgres database engine to perform basic SQL queries. I also created the appropriate datatypes for storing the data and the priviledges for the users (data analysts and data scientists).
